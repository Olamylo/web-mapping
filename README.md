This code repository serves as the course website for ENVM-680 Spring 2016, **Web Mapping**.  The class will provide students with a working knowledge of web-based mapping for a range of applications, including mapping election results, animating the geographic spread of disease, and styling maps of socioeconomic data.  We will rely on the open-source [CartoDB](http://www.cartodb.com) platform.  Students will have the opportunity to create maps and learn about programmatic ways to query large-scale geospatial data, embed maps in blogs, and other modern techniques for analyzing and sharing geospatial information.  Opportunities for learning to program or extending the course will also be presented, although this portion is not a metric for in-class success.
