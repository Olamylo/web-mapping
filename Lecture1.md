This lecture is a gentle introduction to CartoDB, a web mapping service that we will rely on for this course.  We will focus on a particular application: mapping election results for New Hampshire.

1. **Get the data**.  Navigate to the [Harvard Election Data Archive](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/eda) and download [`NH_Shapefile.zip`](), found [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:1902.1/16219).  Click the link and accept the terms of use to save it locally.  The compressed archive (the `.zip` file) has all of the geospatial and metadata associated with a shapefile.

2. **Sign up for CartoDB**.  Navigate to [cartodb.com](www.cartodb.com).  Click Sign Up.
